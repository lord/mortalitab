Your screen probably has more pixels than you have hours in your entire life.

Mortalitab displays a rectangle with one dark pixel for every hour you've already lived and one light pixel for every hour you have remaining, based on your birthday. The flashing white square is the current hour.

What will you do with the hours you have left?
